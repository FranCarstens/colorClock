# [Color Clock](https://francarstens.github.io/colorClock/)

An animated clock with three face styles. 

* The default face has a transitioning background-color. The background-color is determined by the current time which represents an always changing hex color. This hex color is accessible by hovering over the time. 
* The second clock face was inspired by airport flight arrival and departure boards. 
* The third clock face animates a sun and moon visual across the screen. Which visual you see is of course determined by your time of day.

Designed and developed by myself. Enjoy!
